          <h2>Anchr</h2>
          <a href="http://anchrapp.com">anchrapp.com</a>
					<p>Lead Front-end to high-growth startup<br>
          </p>
          <p><br>Anchr is building a platform for location services, founded by a strong team from KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Stockholm School of Economics. The Anchr app has recently been released on App Store and will soon be released on Google Play. Anchr acquired a spot at SSE Business Lab and was, by doing so, verified by the distinguished business leaders Sebastian Siemiatkowski (CEO and founder Klarna), Sebastian Knutsson (founder King), Mikael Schiller (founder Acne Studios), Katarina Martinson (Lundbergföretagen) och Lars Strannegård (President of Stockholm School of Economics). 
				  </p>
				  <p><br>Anchr is entering  a high-growth phase and need to reinforce the team with someone passionate about new technologies and software development. You have the drive, mind and desire to form future interactions between consumers and information about local services in our surroundings. You will be responsible for all front-end development and thrive in the pursuit to deliver excellence in design and user experience. You will have a key role in the company and will work closely with the CEO.
          </p>
					<p><br>Tech we use: React Native, Dropwizard, PostgreSQL, AWS and more.
          </p>
					<p><br>Anchr is creating a platform for location services that allows the end-user to find information and services tied to a location in the easiest possible way. Have you ever booked a lunch with a colleague, but felt unsure of where to go? Maybe you want to plan a lunch and a visit to a museum prior to a weekend trip you are planning. There are many tools available, alone they stand incomplete, but together they create enormous value and empower the end-user by allowing search in a combined huge dataset that Anchr makes available to them. Today's location services demand the end-user to know which services to use and the end-user needs to download several location services in order to receive all the information and offers. Anchr is creating an ecosystem that makes location apps and app data searchable on one single platform. We are also creating a new interface to enable interaction with location data and to steer the end-user to the correct information, offers and services, as seamlessly as possible. Anchr is a search engine for location information and services.

          <p>As Yepstr’s Head of Development you are at the helm of one of Sweden’s fastest growing startups and therefore your drive,
